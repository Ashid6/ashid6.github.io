One of the biggest challenge for web development is compatibility.
When writing a piece of code in C++, Java, Python or even NodeJS, compatibility is rarely an issue.
The production software can be distributes as compiled binaries.
And the source code always has its dependencies which must be fulfilled to run.

But that is not the case for code that runs on web.
There are 2 major components that affect compatibility.

1. Device:
  * Operating System
  * Screen Size
  * Resolution (or DPI)
2. Browser:
  * JS Engine type and version
